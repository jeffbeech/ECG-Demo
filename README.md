# ECG-Demo

These are the files for my Streamlit app to demo the practical application of my project ["Detecting Abnormal ECGs"](https://github.com/jeffbeech/Detecting-Abnormal-ECGs).  An environment.yml file is included for reproducibility.  The demo video can be found [here]( https://github.com/jeffbeech/Detecting-Abnormal-ECGs/tree/main/videos)
